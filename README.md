# Generation-of-Neural-Lyapunov
This a project what I am recently doing. It is about using neural networks to generate Lyapunov function in order to control nonlinear dynamic systems. There are some code in my page which use a neural network in different ways to generate Lyapunov function to guarantee the nonlinear system stablized.
